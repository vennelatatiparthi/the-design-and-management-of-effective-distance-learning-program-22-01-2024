    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Student-Instructor Communication</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the students do not see the instructor on a daily basis, the
        instructor should check email and telephone messages frequently and on
        weekends if possible, so that students are able to get prompt responses
        when they do have questions or require assistance. In addition, by keeping
        specific office hours, the instructor assures students that he/she is available at specific times. To maintain continued student-instructor communication and to prevent students from simply “drifting off” during the
        semester, students are asked to email the instructor every couple of weeks
        to keep him/her informed of their progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Student-Student Communication</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage communication among students and to prevent them from
        feeling isolated in the class, students are required to participate regularly in
        class discussion. It is helpful at the beginning of class to have them share with
        the class some biographical information about themselves. Not only does it
        help them to get to know each other but to better “understand each other’s
        perspectives” (Hanna et al., 2000).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the CMS threaded discussion feature or a listserve, students can
        respond to topics presented by the instructor, ask questions, or read and
        respond to other class members’ comments or questions. Participation in
        discussion is very helpful as it enables them to assist each other in their
        understanding of course material and with assignments. All students in the
        class are able to read other students’ postings in the discussion mode. As
        mentioned previously, as an incentive to encourage students to initiate their
        own discussions with other class members, they are given extra credit points
        for doing so.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although real-time or chat sessions can prove helpful for test review
        sessions and during scheduled instructor office hours, most students do not
        prefer this type of session for discussing course content in large groups. One
        reason is that when a large number of students are logged on at one time, it
        takes a considerable amount of time for the instructor and students to discuss
        a limited amount of course content. Inability to type or a lack of proficiency
        at using the keyboard also makes it difficult for students to respond quickly
        to a discussion question. Additionally, real-time chat sessions require that
        “all participants be online at the same time to communicate” and, therefore,
        often result in “conversation creep,” with the fastest computers getting the
        most “talk time” (Ciabattari, 1997).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative to large group chat sessions is to assign groups of five or
        fewer students to a discussion group. In smaller groups, students will have a greater opportunity to participate and to improve the quality of discussion.
        Additionally, in smaller groups, students are more likely to discuss topics
        more freely, share their own experiences, and feel more a part of the class.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students explain in their end-of-semester class evaluations that they
        generally prefer threaded discussions because they give them time to think
        about their responses first. Threaded discussions also enable them to participate at a more comfortable pace and at times more convenient to their
        schedules. In addition, by having access to their weekly assignments and
        related learning materials beforehand, as they do in the online Business
        Computer Applications course, they are able to progress through the course
        with fewer questions and without a great deal of instructor supervision or
        student assistance.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in online classes where instructors use chat sessions to present
        course assignments, announce test dates, and/or discuss course content, the
        chat sessions are basically a class meeting and the only source of receiving
        information for students; therefore, when students miss a session, they get
        behind in their work.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether the online class uses synchronous or asynchronous communication or both, as in any class some students participate much
        more readily in class discussion than others. By scheduling discussion
        sessions in both formats during the term, however, the instructor provides
        students with the opportunity to engage in the discussion format most
        convenient to them and with which they are most comfortable.</p>
        <h2>Diverse Instructional Materials</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since all students have different learning styles and respond differently
            to various learning activities, it is important to offer them instructional
            materials in a variety of formats. In addition to providing online learning
            materials for each module or chapter such as clearly stated learning objectives, lecture notes, and assignments, automatically graded self-tests that
            evaluate students on achievement of the stated objectives can be included.
            Answers to chapter questions, PowerPoint presentations that summarize the
            main points of each chapter or topic, online videos of class lectures, and links
            to textbook interactive websites can also be included.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory segment of the Business Computer Applications class is
            structured by textbook chapter. When students access the course homepage,
            one of the options or icons with which they are presented is the title and/or
            picture of the textbook. When students select this textbook icon, they view a
            list of chapters. When they select a particular chapter, they are presented with
            links to Web pages such as chapter objectives, lecture notes or study guides, assignments, readings, answers to end-of-the-chapter questions, practice
            tests, and the textbook website.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Microsoft Office segment of the course is structured by software
            application. When students access the course homepage, they are presented
            with a link to the online learning resources of the Microsoft Office textbook.
            When students select this link, they view a list of the various software
            application modules: Windows Environment, Microsoft Word, Microsoft
            Excel, Microsoft Access, Microsoft PowerPoint, and the Internet. For each
            application module, there are links to module objectives, textbook readings,
            assignments, answers to end-of-the-chapter questions and select exercises,
            videos, assigned CD-ROM modules, practice tests, and textbook website.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because students often feel that they are faced with a vast amount of
            information to read and do not have the advantage of hearing class lectures,
            it is helpful to provide test study guides and to schedule optional test review
            sessions either online or on-campus to help them prepare for exams.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, because students in online classes often do not have access
to fast Internet connections, it is advantageous to provide as many instructional materials as possible in CD-ROM format. In the Business Computer
Applications course, students have a CD-ROM that provides an interactive
tutorial to the computer applications. The tutorial is a simulation that sets
objectives, asks students to complete specific tasks on the computer, shows
them how to complete the task if they don’t know, and provides them with
feedback after the completion of each task. By using the CD-ROM, students
are able to work offline and actually receive individualized instruction in
those areas with which they need assistance. CD-ROMs that include videos,
interactive exercises, and glossaries today accompany a number of textbooks.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many textbook vendors have also created their own websites for students
to access, and many of these websites will send results of student exercises or
practice tests to the instructor. By providing links to these sites, students are
encouraged to access them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although students may choose not to access all of the online learning
resources available to them, by presenting a variety of resources, the instructor
increases the chances of reaching each of them at some level; therefore, the
chances for learning are also increased. </p>
<h2> Student Testing</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A continuous dilemma for instructors of online classes is whether to
    utilize online testing or require students to come to campus to take exams.
    Objective style online tests can be automatically graded, and can provide
    immediate feedback to the students, and also eliminate instructor grading. In addition, if a CMS is utilized for online class management, the instructor is
    able to set up tests in advance.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence of online testing though is that the instructor can never
    be sure if the student enrolled in the class actually took the test. In the Business
    Computer Applications course, this dilemma is resolved by requiring students
    to come to campus for a comprehensive final exam and counting it a
    substantial percentage of their final grade.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when students are required to come to campus for
    testing, it often presents a scheduling problem for them. However, on-campus
    testing does eliminate the need for a comprehensive exam counting such a
    large percentage of the grade.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Business Computer Applications course, both testing formats are
    utilized. For the hands-on computer exams, students come to campus. To
    prepare for the applications exams, students can take online practice tests and
    submit them to the instructor for checking.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the theory segment of the course, students take online, automatically
    graded objective tests, and although they are required to take them on specific
    dates, they can take them at any time on those dates. The final exam then
    covers only the theory content and is administered on-campus. Thus far, this
    strategy seems to satisfy most of the students and eliminates the need to count
    the final exam such a large percentage.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ONLINE COURSE EVALUATIONS</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an effort to continually improve online instruction, frequent evaluations throughout the term are extremely useful. Aspacher (1997) suggests
        three separate evaluations during the course.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first survey asking students to evaluate the orientation session can
                be distributed during the first week; the results are helpful in planning
                future orientation sessions. At the midpoint of the course a, telephone
                survey might be used to ask students about their satisfaction with how the
                class is progressing. At the end of the term, a more comprehensive
                written survey can be administered.</p></li>
                <li><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Business Computer Applications course, one of the options
                available to the students is an online “One-Minute Survey.” When
                students access this option, they are asked two simple questions: “What
                in this course helped your learning?” and “What in this course hindered
                your learning?” Although the instructor periodically prompts students to
                complete the survey, they may complete it at any time during the
                semester.
                </p></li>
 <li><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the course, a more formal Online Course Evaluation
    form is sent to students as an attachment. They are asked to complete it,
    print it out, and bring it to class on final exam day. On the evaluation form
    they are asked to evaluate the course, its contents, availability of the
    instructor, learning resources, testing methods, and interaction procedures, as well as their understanding of the class organization and
    grading process. Students are also asked what features they liked best
    and least about the course and are encouraged to make practical suggestions to improve the course</p></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student evaluations help determine the effectiveness of the various
    components of an online course and address areas that may need revision; they
    also communicate to students that their input is valuable.</p>
<h2> Other Tips</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i> Be Knowledgeable of Online Course Technology</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By being familiar with the software and hardware used in the class and
    working through all online class components beforehand, the instructor will
    be able to answer students’ questions—both content-related and technical—
    promptly and with expertise. He or she will also be able to anticipate student
    needs and questions before the class begins, which can prevent student
    problems and frustration later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i> Respond to Student Questions and Problems Quickly </i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By regularly checking email and telephone messages and promptly
    responding to students’ questions and concerns, the instructor lets the
    students know that he/she is readily available and interested in helping them.
    Prompt responses also keep students from feeling isolated in the class.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Student Withdrawals</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major obstacle facing online courses is the large number of student
        withdrawals. Students who enroll in an online course often do not understand
        the requirements necessary for succeeding. Consequently, they drop the
        course when they realize they need a more structured environment. Thus,
        providing information to both faculty and students prior to advisement and
        registration concerning content organization, student expectations, required
        hardware and software, and required computer proficiency is a necessary and
        important factor in student success.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another step that might be taken to minimize the number of student
        withdrawals in online classes is to invite online class members to attend the regular class if they feel they need additional assistance. If both the online
        class and the regular or traditional class follow the same weekly schedule, it
        is easy for them to determine the classes they would like to attend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Student Scheduling</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another approach to meet the needs and schedules of students interested
    in enrolling in an online course is to offer at least two sessions of the class—
    during the day and during the evening. Because students in the Business
    Computer Applications course are required to attend class for the orientation
    session and on selected exam dates, it is important that these sessions be
    offered at times conducive to their schedules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Include Fun Activities</i><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including games or fun activities into the course can add variety to the
    course as well as make learning more fun for the students. “The World Wide
    Web provides a wonderful playground to explore and gain new ideas and
    insights into almost every conceivable topic” (Hanna et al., 2000).</p>
<h2> Advantages of Using a Course Management System (CMS)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If teachers have access to a server but possess limited time or technical
    expertise, they might consider using a commercially developed course
    management system (CMS) to set up and manage the online class. With a
    CMS, instructors must still develop their own course content or individual
    files in HTML format (an easy process when using one of the HTML
    conversion programs), but the CMS software takes care of linking the
    documents for student navigation. Examples of such systems include
    Topclass, Web Course in a Box, and Web CT. The systems generally provide
    their own tools for communication such as email, threaded discussion, and
    teacher announcements. Additionally, these systems grade online student
    tests automatically and allow instructors to track student progress.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WebCT is the CMS used in the management of the Business Computer
    Applications course discussed in this chapter. The system is purchased by the
    school, housed on a school server, and administered by the Information
    Technology Department. Thus, it is available for use by any instructor in the
    school and alleviates faculty members from system administration responsibilities. The use of a CMS or course management system program offers many
    advantages.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all course content, links to websites, online tests, etc., can be set up
    prior to the beginning of class. Instructors do not need to be well-versed in
    programming or be computer experts; if they can create in HTML format the
    various documents that they want to make available to students (objectives,
lecture notes, study guides), uploading them into the CMS is a very simple
procedure. In addition, a CMS can make the course more visually appealing
and more professional looking with little designer expertise on the part of the
instructor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i> “In-house” Communication </i> <br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a CMS, there is no need to establish separate listservs or keep track
    of student email addresses, as these functions are built-in components. Using
    the “email” feature, the instructor or students can send private or personal
    messages to each other, and email addresses of anyone enrolled in the course
    are accessible to all other class members.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructor announcements and topics for class discussions are sent to the
    entire class using the “discussion” mode. Real-time discussions are conducted through the “chat” mode.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a CMS, users are immediately notified when they log on if they
    have an email message or if a new discussion item has been posted, a
    feature that keeps them from having to navigate through the various links
    in order to read any new messages. Additionally when they log on,
    students receive pop-up reminders about tests that are scheduled on that
    day or within the next few days.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Ease of Use by Students</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the course layout and content organization does not change
        during the semester, students become familiar with the location of all online
        components. In addition, they can continue working through class materials
        where they left off the last time they logged on.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Online Testing</i><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By using a CMS, instructors can set up tests in advance. They can import
            test questions from test banks, assign points to each test question and set up
            date and time restrictions. Upon completion of the tests, students can see the
            correct answer to each question, read background information about each
            question and answer, and see their grades immediately. In addition, their
            grades are posted online so both they and the instructor can view them at any
            time during the semester.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><i> Monitoring Student Activity</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a CMS allows the instructor the capability to track student activity
        throughout the term. At any time during the semester, the instructor can check to see which modules students have accessed and the dates on which they
        accessed them. The instructor can also see which modules were accessed or
        completed more than once. Being able to do this gives the instructor the
        capability of observing which students are on task, which ones might need
        some personal assistance or encouragement, and which modules are giving
        students difficulty.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <i> Integration of CMS and School Database</i> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, by using a CMS such as WebCT, the school’s database can be
        used as a source for inputting students into the online class roster. For
        example, all instructors using the WebCT system follow a specific format
        when entering enrolled students; by doing so, they only have to enter students’
        user names. They do not need to input student passwords, as their Social
        Security number is the automatically assigned password—although students
        can easily change it once they are enrolled into the online course. Additionally, when students log on, they are logged on to all WebCT online classes in
        which they are enrolled; and they have to remember only one user name and
        one password.</p>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> CONCLUSION </h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online instruction can offer new challenges and opportunities to both
    students and teachers. They can provide an alternative to regularly scheduled
    classes and can deliver the same services as a regular classroom environment.
    Developing an online course consists of: (1) determining the most appropriate
    technological means for course facilitation and class interaction; (2) planning
    and developing diverse course materials; (3) deciding the most appropriate
    means for student assessment; and (4) determining an effective approach for
    online course evaluation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key to involving students in online learning is to provide them with an
    understanding of how the online class functions and what is expected of them
    as students. Such information can be provided in an orientation session or a
    package of introductory information mailed to the students prior to the
    beginning of class.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of an online class is an ongoing process. As students
    evaluate the various components of the course and its overall effectiveness,
    the instructor is able to make necessary revisions as well as plan and improve
    future online courses. Instructional materials, testing procedures, or scheduled meeting times may change as a result of both positive and negative class
    experiences or as students express their opinions of what helped or hindered their learning in the class. There are a number of instructional components
    and strategies to be considered by instructors or designers when creating and
    implementing an online course. Table 1 presents a checklist of those presented in this chapter.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the course is carefully planned and implemented and the instructor is
    open to student feedback and continuous improvement, online instruction can
    provide an effective educational environment and offer a viable alternative to
    traditional classroom instruction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional research is needed, however, to assess the effectiveness of
    online instruction in this and other classes.</p>
